          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            CELER is a food waste prevention app that directs users to local
            grocery stores offering discounts on foods nearing the end of their
            shelf life. The concept was developed for EcoHack, a
            sustainability-focused hackathon that sought to find creative
            solutions to real problems in the City of Saskatoon. I had three
            days to come up with an idea, sketch a protype, and create a video
            pitch. CELER was shortlisted by a panel of judges and voted first
            place by the City of Saskatoon. I was awarded a $1000 grand prize.

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            In Saskatoon, a pressing local challenge exists as perfectly good
            food gets discarded, while a significant portion of the community
            grapples with food insecurity. This paradoxical situation highlights
            the urgency of tackling both food waste and affordability issues
            within our city. a substantial amount of edible food is discarded
            due to overstocking, nearing expiration dates, or cosmetic
            imperfections. Meanwhile, many people struggle to afford food,
            underscoring the disconnect between available resources and their
            accessibility. Addressing this challenge requires an innovative
            solution that not only minimizes food waste but also ensures
            equitable food distribution, promoting a more sustainable and
            inclusive future for Saskatoon.

          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Location-based Search:</b> CELER identifies nearby grocery
              stores participating in the discount program, making it easy for
              users to access these deals.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Real-time Updates:</b> The app continuously updates the list
              of discounted items, ensuring users have access to the latest
              information and opportunities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Product Details: </b>
              Users can view detailed information about each item: original
              price, discounted price, expiration date, nutritional information,
              etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Notifications:</b> Users can opt to receive notifications when
              new discounts are available.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Community Engagement:</b> The app enables users to share their
              own discoveries and tips for reducing food waste.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Design</h2>
          <span class="image left"

          /></span>
          <p>
            The app is designed to be simple and intuitive. The home screen
            features a list of nearby grocery stores offering discounted goods.
            Users view the store's address and browse its deals. They can then
            click on specific items to view more details. Since this app is
            meant for everyday use, it is important to keep the interface clean
            and uncluttered. The app is designed to be simple and intuitive. The

            used Figma to create the prototype, and made efforts to keep the
            interface clean and uncluttered.

            CELER is a simple yet powerful solution to the problem of food waste
            and food insecurity. It is a win-win for both consumers and
            businesses. Consumers can save money on groceries, while businesses
            can reduce their food waste and increase their revenue.
            <br /><br />At the time of this project, I was still debating
            between majors, and contemplated pursuing a career in software
            development. CELER not only piqued my interest in computer science,
            but also taught me the importance of using technology to solve
            real-world problems. Software is ubiquitious in our lives, and I
            believe it is our responsibility as developers to use it for good.
            Projects that encourage creativity and innovation are a great way to
            get students excited about technology and its potential to make a
            positive impact on the world.
